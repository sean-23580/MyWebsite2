      <h1>Top 10 Tourist Spots in the Philippines</h1>
      
        <h2>Palawan (El Nido & Coron)</h2>
          <p>Palawan has long been inhabited by indigenous groups such as the Tagbanua and Palaw’an. Spanish explorers arrived in the 1600s and called it Paragua. Coron is home to ancient burial sites and World War II-era Japanese shipwrecks, making it a key diving destination.</p>
          <p>Why go? Dramatic limestone cliffs, turquoise lagoons, and world-class diving/snorkeling.</p>
          <p>Highlights: Big Lagoon, Kayangan Lake, shipwreck dives in Coron.</p>

        <h2>Boracay Island (Aklan)</h2>
          <p>Originally home to the Ati people, Boracay remained a quiet, undeveloped island until the 1970s when it began to attract backpackers. It became one of the world’s top beach destinations, but environmental degradation led to a major government-led rehabilitation in 2018.</p>
          <p>Why go? Powdery white sand beaches and vibrant nightlife.</p>
          <p>Highlights: White Beach, Bulabog Beach (kite surfing), Puka Beach.</p>



        <h2>Chocolate Hills (Bohol)</h2>
          <p>The Chocolate Hills are a geological wonder believed to be millions of years old. While science attributes their shape to limestone erosion, local legends say they were formed from the tears of a giant mourning lost love. Bohol also has historical ties to the Spanish era, including the Blood Compact between Spaniard Legazpi and Datu Sikatuna in 1565.</p>
          <p>Why go? Unique geological formations — over 1,200 cone-shaped hills.</p>
          <p>Highlights: Tarsier Sanctuary, Loboc River Cruise, Panglao Island.</p>



        <h2>Banaue Rice Terraces (Ifugao)</h2>
          <p>Carved over 2,000 years ago by the Ifugao people using only primitive tools, these terraces are a UNESCO World Heritage Site. They reflect ancient knowledge of irrigation and sustainable farming. The terraces have been passed down through generations and remain culturally significant.</p>
          <p>Why go? 2,000-year-old rice terraces carved into the mountains.</p>
          <p>Highlights: Batad and Bangaan rice terraces, cultural immersion with the Ifugao people.</p>



        <h2>Cebu</h2>
          <p>The “Cradle of Christianity” in the Philippines, Cebu was where Ferdinand Magellan landed in 1521, introducing Catholicism. He was killed in the Battle of Mactan by the native chieftain Lapu-Lapu, who is now a national hero. Cebu later became a major Spanish colonial port.</p>

        <h2>Mayon Volcano (Albay)</h2>
          <p>Known for its near-perfect cone shape, Mayon has erupted more than 50 times in recorded history. The most destructive was in 1814, which buried the Cagsawa Church and killed thousands. The ruins of that church remain as a historical landmark.</p>
          <p>Why go? Perfect cone-shaped volcano; great for photos and hikes.</p>
          <p>Highlights: Cagsawa Ruins, ATV adventures, Lignon Hill.</p>


        <h2>Siargao Island</h2>
          <p>Once a quiet fishing village, Siargao gained fame in the 1980s when foreign surfers discovered the now-iconic Cloud 9 break. The island remained under the radar until the 2000s and has since developed into a top eco-tourism and surf destination.</p>
          <p>Why go? Surfing capital of the Philippines, natural lagoons, and chill vibes.</p>
          <p>Highlights: Kawasan Falls, Moalboal sardine run, Malapascua Island (thresher sharks).</p>



        <h2>Vigan (Ilocos Sur)</h2>
          <p>A UNESCO World Heritage Site, Vigan is one of the best-preserved Spanish colonial towns in Asia. It dates back to the 16th century and features cobblestone streets, Spanish-era architecture, and old-world charm. It was an important trading post for Chinese and later the Spanish.</p>
          <p>Why go? Spanish colonial town with preserved architecture.</p>
          <p>Highlights: Calle Crisologo, Vigan Cathedral, horse-drawn kalesa rides.</p>



        <h2>Taal Volcano (Batangas)</h2>
          <p>Taal is one of the most active volcanoes in the Philippines, with over 30 recorded eruptions since the 16th century. It was once a large volcano whose massive prehistoric eruptions created the current lake. The nearby town of Taal also features historical houses and the grand Taal Basilica.</p>
          <p>Why go? Volcano within a lake within a volcano.</p>
          <p>Highlights: Boat rides to the volcano, views from Tagaytay.</p>



        <h2>Batanes</h2>
          <p>Isolated in the northernmost part of the Philippines, Batanes has a distinct culture shaped by harsh weather and Ivatan traditions. The Ivatans are known for their stone houses built to withstand typhoons. Batanes was only lightly influenced by the Spanish due to its remoteness.</p>
          <p>Why go? Breathtaking landscapes and traditional Ivatan stone houses.</p>
          <p>Highlights: Marlboro Hills, Basco Lighthouse, rolling hills and cliffs.</p>
